# Project Problems

This project consists of six problems that require the implementation of various algorithms and data structures.

## Problems

### `constructNote`
The `constructNote` function determines whether a given message can be built using the provided letters.

### `averagePair`
The `averagePair` function checks if there is a pair of values in a sorted array that averages to a target value.

### `twoArrayObject`
The `twoArrayObject` function creates an object from two arrays, where the first array provides keys and the second array provides values.

### `sameFrequency`
The `sameFrequency` function determines whether two positive integers have the same frequency of digits.

### `separatePositive`
The `separatePositive` function separates positive integers to the left and negative integers to the right in an array, in place.

### `isSubsequence`
The `isSubsequence` function checks whether the characters in one string form a subsequence of the characters in another string.

### `countPairs`
The `countPairs` function finds the number of pairs of integers in an array whose sum is equal to a given target value.

## Constraints

Each problem has specific time complexity constraints, which are listed below:

- **constructNote**: O(M + N)
- **averagePair**: O(N)
- **twoArrayObject**: O(N)
- **sameFrequency**: O(N + M)
- **separatePositive**: O(N)
- **isSubsequence**: O(N + M)
- **countPairs**: O(N * log(N)) or O(N)

## Implementation

Each problem has a separate implementation file, with clear explanations and comments. The implementations are written in a concise and efficient manner, adhering to the specified time complexity constraints.

## Testing

Each problem has a set of test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementation. The test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the implementation is robust and reliable.
